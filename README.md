# HealthyEating
Let's check out some AI designed media promoting Healthy Eating!

## First, we’re going to focus on a video, but due to lack of AI video generation, I split it up into more of a comic strip. Here is a description of how the process went with the AI along with the finished product.
Initially, I encountered challenges in crafting that impactful marketing punchline or reasoning meant to draw consumers in; the approach was more about getting straight to the point. I chose my topic and then asked GPT to devise a niche marketing idea for a comic strip that would highlight the gain framework. It proposed a plot centered around the irregularities in healthy eating due to remote working, which I thought was pretty good. Subsequently, it generated its own descriptions to feed into Dall-E, aiming to create the most consistent and coherent product possible. Despite its efforts, it struggled to deliver a decisive moment that consumers could truly resonate with, resulting in a more generalized outcome.

I started over and explicitly directed it to achieve what it previously hadn’t —- craft a narrative that conveyed the message more smoothly and naturally. This necessitated multiple restarts, especially when the iterations seemed to diminish in quality. Whenever the results were unsatisfactory, I would push for improvements, prompting it to refine the descriptions it provided to Dall-E. Remarkably, GPT-4 continued to supply Dall-E with developed descriptions for the imagery, sparking curiosity about its ability to maintain consistency, whether in backdrops or the depiction of the character Alex across the frames.

Overall, while the message does get across, it does so in a manner distinct from human storytelling, both in terms of consistency and the ability to resonate with the audience.
